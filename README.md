# python-api-challenge
# WeatherPy and VacationPy are the two components of this challenge.

## ## WeatherPy
Here, the goal was to develop a Python script to display the weather in more than 500 cities around the globe at various equator distances. To achieve this, we'll use a basic Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API to build a global weather representation model. 


## VacationPy 
The idea was to use weather information to schedule upcoming vacations. Created a representative model of weather for cities throughout the world using Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the geoapify API.
